GROCERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The management of the stocks and inventories of a grocery shop is important to make 
the business a success and sustain longer. The basic requirement for this management is to keep 
a good record of stocks and inventories that come into the store and leaves the store of the shop. 
Record keeping is really important, especially when dealing with a perishable product that does 
have an expiration date. The shop owner needs to be aware of the expiration date of the product 
that they sell to avoid any food poisoning and also to avoid any complaints from their customer. 
Nasita Grocery Shop is a shop situated in Kampung Triang, Endau. The shop sells varieties of 
products to the neighborhoods such as a full range of fresh and prepared foods, can foods, 
household cleaners, and cleaning tools, personal care products, and health care products. The 
current practice of stocks and inventories management in Nasita Grocery Shop is using a 
manual system. The number of stock and inventories in and out of the store is recorded daily 
in a book by a staff.
